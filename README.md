## 📖 About the Project
FarmFlow is developed under the **EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service)** initiative. It leverages Artificial Intelligence, IoT sensors, and Web technologies to create a tailored rainwater harvesting experience for rural farmers.

Our mission is to empower agricultural communities with **data-driven water conservation practices** and **climate-resilient farming tools**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
India’s farmers face unpredictable monsoons, leading to:
- Water scarcity or overwatering
- Reduced crop yields
- Lack of accessible water management systems

Traditional rainwater harvesting is **generic**, not adaptive to local field conditions.

---

## 💡 Our Solution – FarmFlow
FarmFlow delivers **personalized harvesting strategies** by:
- Using **real-time sensor data** (moisture, rainfall, etc.)
- Applying **AI models** to generate recommendations
- Providing an **interactive dashboard** to monitor water levels and receive alerts

It enables **intelligent decision-making** for better water management.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- 📊 Real-Time Soil & Rainfall Monitoring  
- 🤖 AI-Based Harvesting Recommendations  
- 📍 Location-Aware Water Insights  
- 🧠 Smart Dashboard for Farmers  
- 📈 Visual Analytics & Predictions  
- 🌱 Climate Adaptation Alerts

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Sensors** capture environmental data (rain, soil moisture).
2. **AI models** process this data to assess water needs.
3. **The dashboard** presents insights and suggestions.
4. **Farmers act** on real-time, tailored harvesting strategies.
